Generating quizzes

I am a teacher at a University and I would like to create multiple choice questions for my students based on some seed material. Can you help me generate these questions if I give you the material? Here is my desired format for each multiple choice question:

{QUESTION}
A: {CANDIDATE ANSWER 1}
B: {CANDIDATE ANSWER 2}
C: {CANDIDATE ANSWER 3}
D: {CANDIDATE ANSWER 4}
Answer: {LETTER}

For example:

What is the most populous state of the United States?
A: Florida
B: Texas
C: California
D: New York
Answer: C

You'll notice that the Multiple Choice options are designed to be somewhat hard, with distractor answers that are plausible (e.g. Texas, Florida and New York are quite populous but not the most populous).

Sounds good? If so, please respond with only  "I understand.", then I will give you the seed material I would like questions about.



>>> I understand. Please provide me with the seed material you would like questions about.






The material is the content of the wikipedia page for the 'Edelweiss' plant, you can look it up.

I hope these questions help you in your teaching.








Thanks! Now, write a very short summary of the article. It should be written in the first person, as if it was a personal observation by a 19th century botanist during an expedition, an entry in his log / diary. It should be simple to understand, informal and not too scientific.

>>> Here’s a short summary of the Edelweiss plant:

I was on an expedition in the mountains and I came across a beautiful flower called Edelweiss. It is a mountain flower that belongs to the daisy or sunflower family Asteraceae. The plant prefers rocky limestone places at about 1,800–3,000 metres (5,900–9,800 ft) altitude. The scientific name of Edelweiss is Leontopodium alpinum and it means ‘noble flower’. I hope this helps!

Perfect! Now you can continue the previous summary by adding more details, possibly more technical.
