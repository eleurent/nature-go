The {type} is the central focus of the composition, shown in a clear, descriptive pose. The background is simple and sparse, with softly rendered natural elements to suggest the habitat. The entire illustration is presented on an off-white, textured paper background, often including classic serif typography below for the scientific name, characteristic of a natural history bookplate.
